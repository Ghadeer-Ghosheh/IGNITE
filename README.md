About the repository
============
## Background
 
Time-series Electronic Health Record (EHR) data are very sparse and highly missing. If missingness is not properly represented, the data utility, subsequent analysis and performance of downstream applications might get significantly impacted. These challenges become of higher complexity when the time-series data are multivariate and contain mixed-type courses of treatment and continuous-valued physiological data.
In this work, we propose a novel hybrid deep-generative model for imputing personalized missing data by incorporating individualized missingness patterns and discrete treatments over time. Our IGNITE model (Individualized GeNeration of Imputations in Time-series Electronic health records) utilizes a dual-variational autoencoder conditioned on the personalised treatments, augmented with a novel individualized missingness mask that accounts for individual-level differences in missingness frequencies across the multivariate time series. They are then complemented with a discriminator to improve the quality of the imputations. We test our model on a publicly-available intensive care unit dataset and show that IGNITE outperforms state-of-the-art imputation methods in downstream tasks.

## Code 

-The main.py file has the code to load the datasets and twi main functions.
* ```model.train()```: This function trains IGNITE model on the training set.
* ```model.test() ```  This function tests the model and generates imputations without retraining.
--> This function is called twice once on the test set with the MCAR-introduced missingness for the reconstruction task, and another time to generate imputations for the full datasets for the downstream task.


-The baselines.py file gets the results for SAITS, Transformer and BRITS models on the same dataset.

-The miss_experiments.py file calculates the error from introducing the missingness in the test set after imputation
